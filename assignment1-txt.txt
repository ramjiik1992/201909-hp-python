Assignment 1
============

* write a function  count_primes to count all primes in a given min,max range

Example

count_primes(2,10) # should return 4

count_primes(2,100) # should return 25


Assignment 2
============

* min should default to 0

Example:
count_primes(100) # should count all primes between 0 and 100


* A Prime Numer is a number that is not divisible by any number between 2 and itself
